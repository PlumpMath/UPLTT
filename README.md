Universial Personal Lecture TimeTable

Provides university/college/company homepage crawling based on yahoo yql and
easy to use GUI for timetable combination based on html/css/javascript(jquery).
Which means you can test it without any web server installed as well.

No db nor files used to save user data that could be the target of cracking.

Any commits for your own university/college/company sites are welcome.
Please hack the UPLTT.js file to understand how it works on your own. Thanks.
